                    <p>I am not a health nut although I would consider myself to be pretty healthy. Besides the occasional pastry here and there. Growing up I was always doing something rather it be sports due to school or simply cycling around Los Angeles because I hated paying for public transportation. I was always in motion. I've found it to be pretty difficult as an adult to maintain that same amount of activity. As an adult you have so many more responsibilities and obligations that have to be followed through on that you lose sight of what is important, which is your health. Well like anything else, with the right concentration and mindset you can get it back on track.</p>
                    <p>Not only is health living a life style but it's also a mindset. I dont know about you but I want to continue to be able to fit into my clothing. I want to love what I see when I look in the mirror. Now before the judgements come, I know that everyone should love themselves regardless. I know and understand this and I agree. I also believe that although you may love who you are, you can also love what you can become too. For me, it's to be someone who is reaonable fit not only mentally and emotionally but also physically.</p>

                <h2 class="top">80/100</h2>
                    <p>Have you ever heard of the 80/20 rule? If not, the 80/20 rule refers to importance of exercise compared to diet. The 80 percent represents the importance of diet and the 20 percent represents the purpose of exercise. Essentially saying that your diet is more important. I am <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/pescatarian-diet">Pescatarian</a>. This means that I don't eat poultry or beef or pork. I simply eat seafood such as fish, crab, etc. Eating this way makes me feel good. You know that heavy feeling that you get after eating steak or pork, when I eat fish I don't feel that way. I feel energized and ready to move around. Also it has many other benefits such as omega three fatty acids.</p>
                <h3 class="top">20/100</h3>
                    <p>Now the portion that most people spend a majority of their time focusing on, exercise. I've recently began cycling again. It's summer time so I'll either ride in the morning when it's cool or I'll ride in the late evening when its beginning to cool down but right before those bugs begin flying around. I've always enjoyed cycling because it's a great way to strengthen your legs and increase the amount of cardio that you do all in one. Another type of cardio is using the stair master. Unfortunately I'm not prepared to risk going to the gym so cycling will have to do. Other than that I've recently tried crossfit. Crossfit is an interesting way of exercising combining cardio and lifting together to help increase stamina and endurance but it is extremely difficult, for me...anyway. So I enjoy simply lifting and cycling. But no matter what you choose to do, the only way you will see progress is by staying consistent. </p>
